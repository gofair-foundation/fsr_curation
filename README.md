# Curation of FAIR Supporting Resource Metadata
This repository supports the GO FAIR Foundation (GFF) process for curating the metadata of FAIR Supporting Resources (FSRs) including FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs) expressed as nanopublications. Uncurated nanopub resources are represented by open issues.

The curation process requires two people, trained based on the [Three-Point FAIRification Framewok](https://www.gofair.foundation/3pff), to play the roles of curator and reviewer.
