# Curation of FAIR Supporting Resource Metadata
This repository supports the GO FAIR Foundation (GFF) process for curating the metadata of FAIR Supporting Resources (FSRs) including FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs) expressed as nanopublications. Uncurated nanopub resources are represented by open issues.

The curation process requires two people, trained based on the [Three-Point FAIRification Framewok](https://www.gofair.foundation/3pff), to play the roles of curator and reviewer.

## Contributing

See the guide on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) that explains the functional curation process in conjunction with the git/GitHub workflow.

This GitHub repository was created by Robin Bramley and Barbara Magagna. We want to thank Indrani Mahapatra for reviewing the contributing guidelines.
