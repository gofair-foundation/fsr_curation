# Curation of FAIR Supporting Resource Metadata
This repository supports the GoFAIR Foundation process for curating the metadata of FAIR Supporting Resources (FSRs) and FAIR Enabling Resources (FERs) expressed as nanopublications. Uncurated nanopub resources are represented by open issues.

The process can be undertaken by qualified FIP (or 3PFF) Implementers/Facilitators/Trainers and the check/review process for each FSR requires two people to fulfil the roles of curator and reviewer respectively.

## Contributing

See the guide on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) that explains the functional curation process in conjunction with the git/GitHub workflow.
