Here are the Nanopub APIs and Searches that are needed in the qualification workflows:
1. Use the API: [**check duplicates**](https://peta-pico.github.io/tapas/tapas.html?api=peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api&op=/find_gofair_qualified_things_x) by searching with the most common name (and similar names) of the FSR if there exists more than one nanopub.
2. Check if the FSR is used in FIPs by using this API: [**find FSRs in FIP**](https://github.com/peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api/blob/main/tables/new_matrix_reduced.csv). You can use this table to search for the FSR Thing URI or its label.
3. For a quick overview you might also want to use the [**FAIRConnect search**](https://fairconnect.pro/search-fair-nanopublications/), where you can find possible duplicates and where you can also get the information about which FAIR Implementation Communities (FICs) are using the FSR in question. Note, here you cannot see the related FIP.
