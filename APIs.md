Here are the two Nanopub APIs and Searches that are needed in the qualification workflows:
1. Use the API: [check duplicates](https://peta-pico.github.io/tapas/tapas.html?api=peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api&op=/find_gofair_qualified_things_x) by searching with the most common name (and similar names) of the FSR if there exists more than one nanopub.
2. Check if the FSR is used in FIPs by using this API: [**find FSRs in FIP**](https://github.com/peta-pico/dsw-nanopub-api/blob/main/tables/new_matrix_reduced.csv)
